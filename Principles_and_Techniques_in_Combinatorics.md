## 1.1 Two basic countinf principles

>[!owo] The Addition Principle (AP) Assume that there are
> $n_1$  ways for the event $E_1$ to occur,
> $n_2$  ways for the event $E_2$ to occur,
> $n_3$  ways for the event $E_3$ to occur,
> etc
> where k >=1. If these ways for the different events to occur are pairwise disjoint, then the number of ways for at least one of the events $E_1,E_2,\cdots$ to ocurr is $n_1+n_2+n_3+\cdots$

> [!definition] Ap
> let $A_1,\cdots,A_k$ be any k finite sets, ehere k >= 1. If given sets ares pairwise dejoint, i,e, $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for i,j =1,2,...,k , then     
> $$|\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_i| = |A_1\cup A_2 \cdots A_k| = \sum_{i=1}^{k}|A_i|$$
